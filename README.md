### Overview ###

The Graph API is the primary way to get data out of, and put data into, Facebook's platform. It's a low-level HTTP-based API that you can use to programmatically query data, post new stories, manage ads, upload photos, and perform a variety of other tasks that an app might implement.

The Graph API is named after the idea of a 'social graph' - a representation of the information on Facebook composed of:

* nodes - basically "things" such as a User, a Photo, a Page, a Comment
* edges - the connections between those "things", such as a Page's Photos, or a Photo's Comments
* fields - info about those "things", such as a person's birthday, or the name of a Page


Specifically for this project, the data related to health units and municipal schools was used to map the incidences
of its units in Natal city.

This project´s goals are:

- Access data from facebook graph API;
- Retrieve data from user profile, pages etc;
- Find out relevant applications with these data

### How to use ###

1. Download the *Facebook friends likes (pages).ipynb*. 
2. After that, use Jupyter notebook tool and access the directory with the files. Enjoy yourself! :)

*Obs: It´s possible to have a preview acessing Facebook-friends-likes(pages).html*

### Final considerations ###

The experience of work with Python and facebook API graph, showed to us the potential of data analysis usign the social
network. However there are many restrictions related to data access security, where most of the edges cannot be accessed.
